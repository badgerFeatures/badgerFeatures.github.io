<p>I'm currently working at The Sunday Times in two roles: as Style Digital Editor and a subeditor.</p>
<p>Previously, I worked as a senior reporter then subeditor at The Kentish Times before moving to The Times and The Sunday Times as a print sub.</p>
<p>My curiosity in code was piqued while I was working on the ST tablet app a couple of years ago. A reoccuring problem that had iOS devs scratching their heads led to a laptop running XCode being placed next to me. Fascinated and realising I was seeing behind the magician's curtain, I decided to learn to code. I've since learnt to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL and Objective-C.</p>
<p><b><u>For fun</u></b> I'm currently developing an iOS app that will provide recipes for busy baking enthusiasts — BusyBaker — with content coming from a colleague at The Sunday Times.</p>
<p>I've also had fun using HighCharts to analyse some <a href="http://julescooper.com/highcharts/newhamRecycles.html">Greater London Authority data</a> that reveals my council to have the worst recyling rate in London, and possibly the country.</p>
<p>I've also made a <a href="http://julescooper.com/fluidtest-2/">website</a> for a band I know...</p>

<p><b><u>For work</u></b> I recently created a <a href="http://www.julescooper.com/podcast-style/trial1.html">pilot webpage</a> for a Sunday Times Style podcast series. It's due to be published in late May, sponsored by River Island.</p>
<p>Since I started working with the Sunday Times Style section, I have introduced biannual coverage of <a href="http://nuk-tnl-deck-prod-static.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/c9e1074f5b3f9fc8ea15d152add07294.html">Fashion Week</a>. I asked writers to provide catwalk reports from New York, London, Paris and Milan, then coordinated the work of sub-editors, designers and deveopers to get the content on line and in the app.</p>
<p>I have used CSS to make <a href="http://julescooper.com/styleCoverTechNew/index.html">fun</a> and <a href="http://julescooper.com/drwho/index.html">interactive</a> pages on the tablet app and to tailor the appearance of <a href="http://times-deck.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/ffeed84c7cb1ae7bf4ec4bd78275bb98.html">quizzes</a>.</p>
<p>In the early days of the current Sunday Times tablet app, I experimented with <a href="http://julescooper.com/ParisFW_iPad/">new ways of displaying content</a> and I still think it would be a good idea to use <a href="http://julescooper.com/interpages/saveArticles/saveArticles.html">animation</a> to ensure readers completely understand sharing and saving.</p>
